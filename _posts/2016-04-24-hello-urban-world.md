## Hello, Urban World!

My name is Ido. For the last year or so, I've been a co-founder in [ZenCity][0], a startup that is trying to change the way cities engage with their inhabitants, using open (and less open) data, digital interfaces, physical devices that affect these interfaces and, well, people.

You could say I'm just starting out my journey into urbanism, starting out with [Jane Jacobs][1] and [William H. Whyte][2] and delving into what's happening in the so-called "Smart City" space around technology, infrastructure, processes and organizations that are trying to make our cities better using technology and data. I'm not alone on this - - many technological companies are starting to show interest in cities, whether it's [IBM][3], one of the pioneers in the field, or more recently, Alphabet (formerly known as Google) with [Sidewalk Labs][4]. In here I will share my thoughts, and more on what I believe that is working and dysfunctional in cities (around Israel and elsewhere) and explain what we do at ZenCity, as we progress in building our product and I make more steps in my personal journey of understanding what makes cities tick.

Besides zooming in on things that I'm interested in exploring around cities, my other interests include editing Wikipedia and being a [Wikimedian][5], pushing for open data in government municipal governments in Israel as part of my work @ [HaSadna][6], and trying to encourage Israeli startups to work with government and the NGO sector, which I know well from my past work with the [National Library of Israel][7] and [Yad Hanadiv][8]. I will touch on some of these topics in the near future. [Everything is connected][9], so stay tuned.
